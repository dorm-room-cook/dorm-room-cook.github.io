## Overview

The goal of Dorm Room Cooks is to provide a one-stop-shop for students to gather/create/view recipes
that can be cooked up in a dorm room or small apartment. Students can browse all recipes or search
for specific recipes and local markets (including supermarkets) can advertise their products indirectly
by crafting delicious recipes and providing ingredient pricing information. Also, vendors' locations and 
store hours are posted conveniently on the website. Users can create a profile and manage
their "items list." Recipes can be filtered to suit the users' specific needs. For example, if they only
have access to a microwave, or only have a few simple ingredients, they can find yummy related recipes,
or simply create a new one to share with others.

## User Guide
### Landing Page - Intro/Featured Recipes
<img src="images/landing-intro-featured.png"/>

This is typically the first page everyone lands on, and the first image that is displayed. 

<img src="images/landing-mission.png"/>

After scrolling a bit further down the landing page, you will find the Mission Statement. 
If it's too much to read, or you're just not interested, use the button to close/open the
additional text.

<img src="images/landing-numbers.png"/>

These are some fake statistics generated and can be easily updated to fit your needs.

<img src="images/landing-sponsors.png"/>

The sponsors section of the landing page lists several sponsors. None of these local
markets sponsored this app development, but if you do have sponsors this is a great
place to list them. One added feature is that only a handful of sponsors are displayed
and are randomly generated to appear on the landing page.

<img src="images/landing-reviews.png"/>

Users can feel free to post recipe reviews or general site reviews here. Perhaps they
want to post a link to a website with even more recipes even. That is great.

<img src="images/landing-footer.png"/>

The footer just contains some standard info. The links can be used to generate filtered
recipe lists or information about different cuisines. The "Meet the Dev Team" link
features our profile cards.

At the bottom of the page, feel free to click the little green arrow on the bottom, 
right corner to smoothly transition back to the top of the page without having to
manually swipe or scroll the mouse.

### About Us Modal
<img src="images/about-us.png"/>

### All Recipes Page
<img src="images/all-recipes.png"/>]

The Recipes section of the app can be accessed by clicking the Recipes tab at the top of the page.
Once clicked, the page displays all available recipes.

<img src="images/all-recipes-search.png"/>]

If searching for a specific recipe, the search bar at the top of the page is available. Likewise,
if lost half-way down the page hit the button to auto-scroll back to the top.

### Recipe Details Modal
<img src="images/recipe-details-modal.png"/>
<img src="images/recipe-details-description.png"/>

Once a recipe looks appealing enough to test out, click the "view details" button to see the
specific instructions and ingredients needed. It is a pop-up display, so you will not be
re-directed to another page.

### Search Vendors Page
<img src="images/vendors-search.png"/>

To see a list of local vendors and locations, click the Vendors tab at the top of the page.

### Sign-in Dropdown
<img src="images/signin-dropdown.png"/>

Ready to do more? Sign in or register to start building recipes. Vendors need to first be approved
by the site admin to take on the vendor role.

### Add Recipe Page
<img src="images/my-recipes-add-recipe.png"/>

Once logged in, users will see one or two new options at the top of the page. The "My Recipes" tab
is now available and if clicked, a list of recipes created by the current user is available. Also,
the user has the option to add a new recipe. 

<img src="images/add-recipe.png"/>

This is the form for adding a new recipe. It is fairly self-explanatory, but the important thing
to note is the little red star means the field is mandatory.

### Edit Profile Page
<img src="images/edit-profile.png"/>

Click on the right-hand drop-down menu at the top and click, "Edit Profile" to update your profile.
You will be able to see changes made once you hit the submit button.

* Must be signed on as a valid user with a profile at this time.

### My Ingredients Page
<img src="images/grocery-list.png"/>

Vendors also have access to a list of ingredients. If signed in as a vendor, first click on
the Ingredients page. You can then have the option to add, remove, or edit ingredients. These will
be linked with the recipes you create so if a user clicks on your recipe you can possibly send
targeted advertising or promote sales on ingredients.

### Signed Out Page
<img src="images/signed-out.png"/>

Sign-out from the drop-down nav menu at the top of the page.

##### Add-on Feature - Responsive Design (Mobile Friendly)
<img src="images/menubar-browser.png"/>
<img src="images/menubar-mobile.png"/>

Users accessing the app on a mobile device will see a different nav bar. Pages can be easily viewed
on a mobile device; however, if you are a vendor and wish to update your ingredients list, we recommend
the browser version.
